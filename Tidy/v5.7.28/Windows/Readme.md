*Tidy 5.7.28* *.bin*s for *Win*
-------------------------------

- Needed the (*64bit*) *.dll* for [[SO]: Python exception thrown by libtidy is amusingly impossible to catch (@CristiFati's answer)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59054833/python-exception-thrown-by-libtidy-is-amusingly-impossible-to-catch/59071499#59071499), but built all the rest
- Used *Visual Studio 14.X* (2017)
- The *.exe* is built with the **static** *.lib*
